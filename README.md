# Hello!
Hi there, you've stumbled upon my CS:GO Config files!

These include: 
- Half-life sounds
- Gamemodes
- Shortcuts and more!
  
Leave me a +rep on my [Steam Profile](https://steamcommunity.com/id/limatt/) if you like it :)
   
### Installation
- Open Steam
- Locate CSGO
- Right Click and click on "Browse local files"
- Browse to csgo -> cfg
- Place all .cfg files in there

### Credits
autoexec.cfg uses elements from [FranzJ's old config](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIck3ZEXIfU)
